Added  switch  /swap_endian 
		swaps the endian of the  flash data – backup only

Added switch /flash_debug
		provides debug information when detecting flash chip 
		manufacturer and device ID

Added new option -probeonly:custom 
			requires only /window: when probing flash chips

Added preliminary SPI for detection and read/write to serial flash chips
		Big Thanks, Yoon Lee, Joey Goncalves, and openwrt kernel developers for the SPI code
 		and porting the Atheros base SPI to tjtag.

Added preliminary Broadcom SPI code, for detection and read/write on Broadcom based
 		processors.
		Big Thanks to eko@dd-wrt.com, for donating the WGR614v8 and endless
 		hours of testing with me, without, we would have no Broadcom SPI.

		Big Thanks to BrainSlayer – DD-WRT.COM for your support

		Big Thanks to Chip for his FON2200 and flash chip definitions and
 		testing on the FON 2200

		Also Big Thanks to all the others at DD-WRT for helping me test and
 		reporting back, RedHawk, Barryware, and others.

Added options to backup, flash, erase
		wgrv8bdata,  wgrv9bdata, cfe128


NOTES
SPI has only had limited testing, but has been verified to work on:

Fonera 2200A “Thanks for the donation desigabri”
DIR-300
WGR614v8	“Thanks Eko” - 128k CFE
WGR614v9	128k CFE

All of the above targets require a /swap_endian switch when backing up.
The WGR's require /noreset “BCM5354 processors” also the WGRV8 and WGRV9 have 128k CFE's. 

There are probably others it will work on as well, but due to the limited test targets available to me, this is all that has been tested.
There are a few newer commands and switches for these new routers.

For the wgr614v8 and wgr614v9 there are:

Board specific data “MAC address, etc”
Ex. backup:wgrv8bdata /noreset /swap_endian
EX. flash:wgrv8bdata /noreset

Board specific data “Mac address, etc”
Ex. backup:wgrv9bdata /noreset /swp_endian
Ex. backup:wgrv9nvram /noreset
